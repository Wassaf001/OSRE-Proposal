# Open Source Research Experience (OSRE) Proposal

## Project Title: Lossless Compression of Raw Data for the ATLAS Experiment at CERN

### Description
The project aims to address the challenge of managing the increasing data rates at the ATLAS experiment by implementing and evaluating state-of-the-art lossless compression algorithms for raw data. With the planned upgrade of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) to its High Luminosity phase, the recorded data rate is expected to increase significantly. The project will focus on improving compression methods to reduce storage requirements while maintaining data integrity.

### Task Ideas
- Implement (de)compression of ATLAS RAW data using algorithms such as zstandard and brotli.
- Study the performance of compression algorithms in terms of compression ratio and speed under various data-taking conditions.
- Optimize algorithm settings to achieve the best compression results.

### Expected Results
- Identification of best-suited compression algorithms for lossless compression and decompression of ATLAS raw data.
- Evaluation of algorithm performance under different scenarios, considering luminosity and other data-taking conditions.

### Requirements
- Proficiency in C++
- Knowledge of compression algorithms and techniques
- Familiarity with data analysis tools and techniques

### Mentors
- Maciej Szyma≈Ñski
- Peter Van Gemmeren

### Duration
175 hours

### Difficulty Level
